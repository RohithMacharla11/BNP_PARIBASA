## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 20 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or another package manager like yarn or pnpm)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    You will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project to store your API keys. You can copy the example file to get started:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, open the `.env` file and add your Google AI API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```

### Running the Application

This project consists of two main parts: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows. You'll need to run both concurrently in separate terminal windows.

1.  **Run the Next.js development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your application will be available at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

2.  **Run the Genkit development server:**
    In a new terminal window, run the following command to start the Genkit flows:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This will start the Genkit development environment, allowing the Next.js app to communicate with the AI models.
